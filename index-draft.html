				## CommonsPub
				the quest for a modular decentralised app ecosystem

				> Technology is not neutral. We're inside of what we make, and it's inside of us. We're living in a world of connections — and it matters which ones get made and unmade.

					We are building CommonsPub as a way to claim back our creativity and power to play with technology

				## Why ActivityPub?

				ActivityPub and the fediverse today are great for data-level interoperability, between different apps on different servers
				
				CommonsPub wants software-level interoperability as well, with different apps sharing large parts of their code
			</section>
			
			<section data-markdown data-background-image="assets/roots.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
				Instead of a top-down “product design” approach to building an app or platform, we’d like a world where even non-technical users and communities can do it themselves
			</section>

			<section data-markdown data-background-image="assets/firewood.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
				You should able to piece together custom experiences from an ecosystem of apps and plugins developed by different groups who all contribute to (and benefit from) a pool of interdependent software libraries, while each focusing on different use cases, features and user experiences.

			<section data-markdown>
				### The CommonsPub ecosystem
				#### CommonsPub::Lab
				#### CommonsPub::Academy
				#### CommonsPub::Apps
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
				## CommonsPub::Lab
				A space that contains all the libs, ui modules, config files and various experimentations that can be used to build apps
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
				### CommonsPub::Lab
				* an ActivityPub library that is de-coupled from the rest of the app
				* a universal database identifier keying scheme
				* config-driven database schemas + validation
				* UI modules
				* a lot of convenience apis around the database
			</section>

			<section data-markdown data-background-image="assets/untangled.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.3"
				data-background-position="bottom">
We have decoupled the federation and storage of ActivityStreams activities/objects from the app’s relational database, backend logic, APIs and frontend interfaces.
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
package up models that we can share with other applications that have a slightly different view of the world.
			</section>
			
			<section data-markdown data-background-image="assets/campfire.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
We have implemented groups (to further decentralise the fediverse by rendering users and communities independent from the instance they’re on),
			</section>

			<section data-markdown data-background-image="assets/juggling.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
Users can have one fediverse identity and a timeline which shows all types of content and activities in one place, while participating in multiple communities and using specialised apps for different activities.
			</section>

			<section data-markdown
			data-background-image="assets/taxonomy.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
Federated taxonomies for opt-in search indexing, and topic-based discovery across instances.

but what none of this really tells you is how much fun it is to build! when you suddenly have extreme freedom to go from thought to execution (that execution time doesn't lag behind thought time too much), you just find yourself building cool things instead of puzzling them out!

it's like a framework, except it's just a bunch of libraries and that build upon existing frameworks and librarie (like Phoenix for web and Ector for database), as well as sample apps which you can use/modify/extend/fork...
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
				## CommonsPub::Academy

				A space to learn and share knowledge and experiences about CommonsPub
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
				### CommonsPub::Academy

				* Documentation
				* Tutorials
				* Courses
				* Classes
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
				## CommonsPub::Apps

				All the apps built on top of CommonsPub
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
				### CommonsPub::Apps

				* **VoxPub**: a simple [micro]blogging app
				* **HAHA Academy**: share educational knowledge and encourage lifelong learning
				* **Bread.pub**: Offers & needs bulletin board for mutual aid and circular economies
				* **OpenTasks**: Coordinate tasks and activities in federated networks
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>## And one more thing...</section>

			<section data-markdown># Bonfire</section>

			<section data-markdown>
### Bonfire will be...

#### 1. a device
#### 2. a fediverse hosting service
#### 3. a CommonsPub app
			</section>

			<section data-markdown data-background-image="assets/device.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
### 1. Bonfire the device

- use CommonsPub apps offline or with people on your local network (Temporary Autonomous Zones)
- ready to use (plug in and play)
- based on Rasperry Pi
- runs CommonsPub apps
- install and remove any CommonsPub apps/extensions easily, no coding required
- comes with all the building blocks for creating your own apps
			</section>

			<section data-markdown data-background-image="assets/servers.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
### 2. Bonfire the fediverse hosting service

- syncs between your Bonfire and the fediverse whenever your device is online
- link it to your own domain name (or use `your-instance.bonfire.cafe`)
- runs open source software, so you can self-host instead
- open to cooperating with others wanting to run compatible services
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
### 3. Bonfire the CommonsPub app

- shows all your fediverse feeds and notifications in a single place
- you can run it on the Bonfire device, or on your own computer or server
- install and remove any CommonsPub extensions easily, no coding required
- allows you to easily configure and customise everything
			</section>

			<section data-markdown>
Bonfire buils upon the CommonsPub ecosystem as an attempt to ensure sustainable FLOSS developement and
maintainance. 

We're probably going to launch a crowdfunding campaign to help make it happen.
